## Olist-Sales-Project

### Context

This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

### Data Schema

The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. Please refer to the following data schema when working with it:

### Hypothesis: 
•	If the price of the product increases, then payment instalment decreases.
•	Highest priced product is bought during between 8 am to  8 pm. Most orders are placed between 7 am to 12am.
•	Price of the product and payment value differs, could be due to discounts or offers or defaults.


### Limitations
This dataset is from 2016 to 2018 which means that the insights would not be of current trend of Olist. Additionally, this dataset is of Brazil and the recommendations are not relevant for other markets. There is no much clarity on the currency of payments, prices, and shipping charges. Since Olist is a Brazilian company, assuming Real as the currency. The dataset does not have further breakdown of devices the orders were placed. 

### Ethical Considerations
The data is available on Kaggle and is provided by Olist and 3 other collaborators. Kaggle is an open-source data sharing platform and might not provide data reliability and authenticity. Also, there is no much clarity on how the data is collected. There could be potential collection biases.
